# Scripts to construct the Feature Extraction Resources

The scripts in this folder were used to construct the resources utilized for the feature extraction of the CookieBlock
Feature Extractor.

The input format can vary. For some script a CookieBlock consent crawl database is expected, in others the training
data in the format of a JSON file is required.

* `name_features.py`: Extract a ranking of the most common terms inside cookie names.
