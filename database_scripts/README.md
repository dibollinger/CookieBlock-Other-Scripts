# Database Scripts
This subfolder contains scripts to perform operations on the database produces by the consent label crawler.
This includes altering/sanetizing the database using SQL commands as well as extracting the JSON training data 
from the retrieved database of cookies.

## Folder Contents
* `example_db/`: Contains a database produced from a consent crawl targetting 300 domains, 100 for each CMP.
* `sql_commands/`: Contains some queries, commands and assertions which may be useful. Some of these are used by `post_process_db.py`.
* `stats/`: Will store crawl and content statistics files as output by `post_process_db.py`.
* `training_data_output/`: Contains the training data, i.e. the JSON files produced by `extract_cookie_data.py`.
* `extract_cookie_data.py`:

    Matches the cookies stored in the `javascript_cookies` table with the declarations in the `consent_data` table
    of the given input database by name and domain. This produces a list of cookies with associated consent label 
    and purpose description, which can be used as input to a classifier.
    
    Any cookies that do not belong to the main 4 categories `(0: necessary, 1: functional, 2: analytics, 3: advertising)`
    are filtered out from the resulting dataset. Cookie deletions are ignored.
    
    Output JSON structure:
    ```
    [
     "cookie_id_01": {
       "name": "<name>",
       "domain": "<domain>",
       "path": "/path",
       "cmp_origin": [0-2],
       "label": [0-3],
       "variable_data": [
         {
         "value": "<cookie content>",
         "expiry": "<expiration in seconds>",
         "session": true/false,
         "http_only": true/false,
         "host_only": true/false,
         "secure": true/false,
         "same_site": "no restriction"/"lax"/"strict"
         },
         ...
       ]
     },
     "cookie_id_02 : {
        ...
     },
     ...
    ]
    ```
    Where `variable_data` contains all updates for a single cookie. 
    
    In addition, some statistics are also produced, such as counts of cookies per CMP.
* `post_process_db.py`: 

   First, backs up the database. Then, cleans empty tables out of the database and runs some sanity checks on them.
   Next, it creates a number of views inside the database to allow easier analysis of certain datapoints in the database.
   
   Finally, it runs a number of queries to output a large range of statistics. This includes:
   - Total URLs visited.
   - Number of successful CMP crawls.
   - Number of CMP crawl failures.
   - How many crawls were interrupted before retrieving the CMP data?
   - How many crawls were interrupted during the browse phase?
   - All errors ordered by type.
   - Number of cookies in database
   - Number of declarations in database
   - How many unique cookies and declarations
   - Cookie counts separated by purpose.
